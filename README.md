Hummingbird Report System
============================

Business reports are the key point of the success of product operation in developement.
However, the development of immediate reports is not that easy for programmers.
So that lack of data support is usually situation in start up stage. In order to making
some really important decision, product managers will ask programmers for help.
These repeatedly data requirements of product managers hurt the efficiency of programmmers much.

Actually, most of reports could be implemented by a single SQL statement, but the coresponding
user interface and reports export functionality will cost a lot of time. Which motivated me to
design and implement this report system helping programmer transfer the single SQL statement to
user friendly reports. In this report system, a simple report could be done in less than one minute.
